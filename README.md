# COS 426 Final Project - DIGWORLD

DIGWORLD is a first-person, 3D platformer video game with a focus on engaging player movement in a dynamic and modifiable environment. Core features of the game include procedural generation, real-time environment geometry manipulation, and momentum-based movement and character control. The objective of the game is to collect as many randomly-spawning ‘points’ as possible while traversing the game’s 3D environment, achieved by means of using the ‘terraforming’ controls to modify the environment – adding and deleting terrain at will – as one is navigating it. In this regard, a core motivation for our development of the game was to create a unique system of player-to-game-world interactions that are inherently fun to engage with and evoke a sense of novelty. As a result, DIGWORLD features several mechanics of technical interest, notably: procedural generation of a 3D environment using fractal noise / fractal brownian motion, use of the Marching Cubes algorithm to generate mesh geometry from an underlying 3D scalar field, and real-time modification of environmental mesh geometry by means of chunking. The player input of DIGWORLD adheres to a traditional standard for traditional keyboard-based movement controls: the WASD keys control player movement direction with respect to the current first-person view direction, which is controlled by the mouse. In addition, the ‘Q’ key is used to bring up a birds-eye minimap view, which helps the player locate themselves in relation to ‘points’ around the map, and the left ‘Shift’ key triggers a grappling hook, which allows the player to propel themselves about the map using the environment geometry.
